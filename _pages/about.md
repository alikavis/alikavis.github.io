I am currently a postdoctoral fellow at UT Austin, affiliated with the IFML and the TRIPODS institute. I have obtained my PhD degree from EPFL in August 2023. My research focuses on developing universal and parameter-free algorithms for solving stochastic optimization problems. My interests range from first-order minimization problems to second and higher-order methods, as well as their extensions to variational inequalities, games and min-max optimization.
