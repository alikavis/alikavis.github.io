I am a last year PhD candidate at EPFL, Switzerland. My research focuses on developing universal and adaptive algorithms for solving stochastic optimization problems. My interests range from first-order minimization problems to second and higher-order methods, as well as their extensions to variational inequalities, games and min-max optimization.
