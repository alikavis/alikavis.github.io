I am on the 2025-2026 Academic Job Market! I am currently a postdoctoral fellow at UT Austin, affiliated with the IFML and the TRIPODS institute. I have obtained my PhD degree from EPFL in August 2023. My research focuses on developing universal and parameter-free algorithms for solving stochastic optimization problems. My interests range from first-order minimization problems to second-order methods, their extensions to games and min-max problems and applications in deep learning.
